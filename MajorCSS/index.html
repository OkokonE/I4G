          I starting this training as a novice but thus far, I have a good
          understanding of what html and css is. I can work my way around
          creating a web page with html <i>(the skeleton of the page)</i> and
          css <i>(the beautifier of the page)</i>.

          CSS is very important as it is used to give beauty to a web page that
          has html skeleton. The features available include; color, text
          alignment, padding, margin, font style, font width e.t.c

        <p class="third"><b><i>Difference between Padding, Margin and Border?</i>:</b></p>
        <p class="third">
          <i>Padding</i> is used to create space around an element's content,
          inside of any defined borders. <i>Margin</i> properties are used to
          create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
          <i>Border</i> property is a shorthand syntax in CSS that
          accepts multiple values for drawing a line around the element it is
          applied to.
